# HP Prime on the Web

Use the calculator [here](https://mathewbushuru.github.io/hp-prime-web)

HP Prime is a ~$200 graphing calculator with  smartphone-like features as shown below.

This project aims to create a browser emulation of the calculator and to also implement its default apps (advanced graphing, 3D graphs, geometry, spreadsheets, statistics, linear solver, user generated apps with the PPL programming language, etc)

I'm currently developing it using vanilla javascript but will convert it to a react project once it increases in complexity.
